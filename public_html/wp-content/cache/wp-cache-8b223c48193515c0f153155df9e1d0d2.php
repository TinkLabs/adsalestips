				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Todays advertising sales professional is fighting in the trenches each day to close deals, its very common for a advertising sales person to develop a thick skin, given that we hear the words ‘no’ before we get a yes. In today’s recovering market not every brand is buying. Having said all that, This year has been our best year in 15 years, we have broken all print, digital &#038; web advertising targets, why? The year we recruited 1 additional area manager with a great deal of experience to match the current teams experience, skills and qualities, we then split the markets to allow each area manager to ‘FOCUS’</p>
<p>Lets talk about that word ‘FOCUS’ advertising sales requires ‘FOCUS’ we need to make sure thats we understand which prospects can invest against the prospects that have a budget freeze. Then it is vital that we ask the right questions, todays success is giving our clients exactly what they are looking for and delivering it. It is possible to convert all your appointments into sales if you listen to what they want.</p>
<p>The proposal should not be an effort to sell everything from your portfolio, brands have budget to spend on the things they need and want, so its simple, ‘sell them what they need’</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Never loose belief in yourself!</p>
<p>Always go back to your basic training, leverage all your experience and think back to all your successes and glorious advertising sales deals. When selling media or advertising the market conditions and your product or service are the main factors, ok, they say never to blame your tools, but, in todays market conditions, the targets requirements are changing, more and more people are using multi-platforms at different times of the day depending on what they are doing, this means the product or service you are selling needs to adapt and change for todays target audience, advertisers are under extreme pressure to get a return on their investment, which is correct, so, help them.</p>
<p>What happens if you stay static and reluctant to make the necessary changes?</p>
<p>The answer is simple, slowly you will loose clients and the up hill struggle begins. A great sales person listens to what clients want and to the market conditions, this means a sales person should be free to sell the perfect solution for that client , if you are struggling to provide clients what they are looking for then you have two simple decisions to make:</p>
<p>• Adapt your product or service accordingly<br />
• Cut your losses and find a product or service you truly believe in selling</p>
<p>Sales can be very rewarding, but only when all the elements meet, the product or service needs to meet the clients requirements and get results to deliver client satisfaction. Only then can you feel light and nimble to get the desired results for your and your product.</p>
<p>I have worked in many blue chip media companies and now have my own media company, I have always said that the hardest role in the company is the sales role, sales are the tip of the sword that can make the difference between winning and loosing, all the other departments need to work in sync to be able to service the sales team so that they can get the best results for the whole company.</p>
<p>Stand up and be counted, as a sales person you are the front line of any media company, don’t be afraid to tell your team mates what needs to change in order to get the best results.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In advertising sales we are always working to deadlines, be it a print deadline, a simple campaign or an annual target; it is always important to remain focused and keep your eye on the prize. Personally I always have all my prospects up on a big board with the names of the potential advertisers and the $ amount along side; as each deal is closed I use a thick red marker and write “booked”, plus I make a tick alongside the advertiser. At the top of the board I have the revenue target and alongside a running total of sales paid to date. I am 100% focused on reaching that target, if I start to see some crosses rather than ticks that motivates me to find even more prospects.</p>
<p>I also have become very disciplined schedule-wise, as the years go by: in the morning I check my emails, and double check my replies very carefully, I then focus on new business development, which means booking new appointments and looking for new prospects; around 4pm I change my frame of mind and work on my proposals.</p>
<p>When it comes to working on my proposals I have learnt to personalize each one of them, I really take the time to tailor each proposal making sure that it’s perfect for each client: once I send the proposal by email I make a note in my agenda of when it was sent, and then mark a date for the follow-up (normally one week after the first email). I then follow up with a call or a second email, depending on the client’s availability. Once a proposal has been sent I follow that proposal like a hound and make sure I get a reply. Of course if the reply is positive great! If not then I need to ask questions as to why my offer was not agreeable and look to adapt the proposal in order to close the sale.</p>
<p>Being focused is vital, making sure you as an advertising sales person are effective each day. If you are disciplined, focused, you will never get distracted from the goal at hand.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In most cases today&#8217;s advertisers have a print campaign that will follow with a digital campaign shortly after, today&#8217;s advertisers are far more likely to invest in a multi-platform that is fully integrated. The info graphic images show a hypothetical example following:<br />
<span id="more-2401"></span></p>
<p>• Editorial in print: By placing a QRcode on the print editorial it is then possible to link the editorial to a landing page or the digital magazine or their website<br />
• The Digital magazine: Digital adverts can have both embedded video for longer reader engagement and link the advert back to a landing page or the advertiser&#8217;s website<br />
• Web: It is important today that your website is responsive so that your content can be read on any device and interconnects with your other platforms<br />
• Newsletters: Excellent tool that can be linked back to a landing page or the advertiser&#8217;s site, plus inviting subscribers to an Event</p>
<p>Advertisers prefer to buy a package which includes print, digital &amp; web advertising that can be tracked, editorial support which can appear on all platforms &amp; social media which can also be tracked, &amp; client events; finally a report should be produced at the end of the campaign which can clearly show where all the traffic came from and from which platforms.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My own brand LUXOS has been a controlled circulation title for 14 years and as we have a severe distribution monitoring system we have never felt the need to have our print, web &amp; digital products audited, however, more and more media agencies play a bigger role in where the brand invests their budget. Media agencies like to tick the boxes and one of those ticks is that a title must be BPA audited in order to advance to the next round of talks. I recently sent out the official communication to all our clients about this new BPA and while I am sure nothing would have changed should we not signed up to be BPA stamped, I did see a relief in our clients replies, it seems to put any doubts that could have been in the air to rest. Let me know your comments and I invite you to share your experience in the subject</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I consider myself a pretty good sales person, however by nature I have a tendency to try and please my advertisers, which means I say ‘yes’ too easily: I need some tips on Negotiating please?</p>
<p>Tip: In my experience you can be an amazing sales person but a poor negotiator. It is a fact that all the top media agencies send their media buyers to negotiation courses, therefore in order to level the playing field we, as sales people, also need to have training on negotiating.Let me give you a tip: We all have a rate card, if the customer says the rate is too high and starts talking about the CPT, your first instinct needs to be to handle it as an objection and start to negotiate up, not down. If the client also showed an interest in web, digital, newsletters, editorial or double pages over single page adverts, these can all be used a variables. Preserve the rate amount by using your bag of variables as added value, the client might be very interested to send out an exclusive newsletter or take a banner advert on your website or run a double page over a single page, use these variables to bolster the package and maintain the dollar amount.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have recently been promoted from classified sales to selling display advertising, this means I must have a minim of 10 face to face meeting per week, I am struggling in my first month to get 5 appointments and my conversation rate is very poor, when I sold classified I was very good at getting prospects to buy over the phone, now that I have to meet clients and agencies something is not working, what am I doing wrong?</p>
<p>Tips: Sounds to me that you are experiencing a problem with the quality of your appointments, let me help. Advertisers and agency people are often very busy and the harsh truth is they often stick to what &#038; who they know that works and is comfortable; buying from your competition, or buying less than they should, until you get the opportunity to meet them you are unable begin to persuade them to consider new and alternative ideas. Unlike many sales directors I prefer quality appointments over quantity, which means I have the decision maker in front of me, I am clear on my goals and objectives behind the meeting, today my conversation rate is around 90% for that reason I ‘structure time to get appointments’</p>
<p>A sales person or sales assistant making appointments must come in every morning with a goal of contacting sufficient prospects to reach the desired quality of appointments in a week, decide on which area or which client group you intend to target and stick at it for as long as it takes until you have succeed to fix the desired amount of appointments, if a prospect asks you to call back, ask them when would be convenient and make sure to call them back at the that exact time.</p>
<p>Have a list of calls you wish to make every morning, this is the key, do not waste time thinking about who you should call, at the end of each day before you go home have your list of calls on your desk or computer for the following morning, this helps keep clarity in your mind plus a clear objective for your appointment fixing in addition, sales people can make it even easier to create momentum if they send an appointment request email the night before so that in the morning you should have some replies to work on when you get into the office. Remember, if you are making appointments for yourself or for your sales director, the quality of that appointment makes all the difference to being effective and bring home the bacon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>From a user:</strong><br />
I graduated last year in business studies and I’ve been trying to get a job with very little success. Last month I started working for a small publishing company in London that gave me a one hour product training and a telephone; I wanted to resign that very same day but instead I thought: why not use this for experience, give it 100% and see where it all ends up. I went online to find some advertising sales advise and came across this site and subscribed to the sales process course which was a real eye opener: the company I work for does not believe in face-to-face calls, I am unable to send out a copy of the magazine, I can only make 60 calls per day and send out my media kit by email. I need some telephone sales tips please?</p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong><br />
Do not panic, help is here. I actually started my career when I was 17 in telesales, it can actually be fun and a real buzz; on the telephone you can be whatever you want, picture yourself a tall confident person, determined and powerful.<br />
&#8211; Each day start with a positive attitude<br />
&#8211; Learn your pitch back to front, know everything there is to know about your title and industry<br />
&#8211; Identify 60 contact calls each day, before going home each evening, move across the calls that you could not reach and add the difference, always start the day with 60 names to call<br />
&#8211; Keep an agenda clean and organized, when prospect asks you to call back, make a note when to call back and then call them back<br />
&#8211; As you are starting out, go online and read about DIPADA OR AIDA steps, super basic but this will help you get started<br />
Whether you are selling face-to-face or over the telephone the same principles apply. The key is, when you get someone on the phone make sure the first thing you say will catch their attention and interest, then ask some quick open questions to make sure you are on track and present your unique selling points; finally, before you end the call, ask the prospect if they have an interest and then try and trail close to test the water. Whatever you do, never read from a script, telephone sales is 80% about using your sunny personality to the point they can even hear your smile on the phone.</p>
